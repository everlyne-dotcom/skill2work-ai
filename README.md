# Skill2Work AI

🌍 **AI-powered career pathway recommender for African youth**

Skill2Work AI bridges the gap between training and employment by making Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) more responsive to real-time labor market demand.  

## 🚀 Problem
Millions of young people in Africa complete TVET programs but still remain unemployed because the skills they learn are not aligned with what the job market needs.

## 💡 Solution
Skill2Work AI uses Artificial Intelligence to:
- Analyze real-time job market data and employer requirements
- Recommend updated training pathways for students
- Provide insights for TVET institutions and policymakers
- Connect learners with relevant job opportunities

## 🎯 Impact
- Improves employability of youth and reduces skill mismatches  
- Helps TVET institutions update curricula faster  
- Empowers women and underserved communities with better access to work opportunities
